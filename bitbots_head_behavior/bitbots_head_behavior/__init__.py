"""
BitBots Headbehavior uses the dynamic_stack_decider package to achieve dynamic but also easy to maintain
behaviour definitions.

In general the Head acts independently of the Body. It can be configured to look for different field features like
ball, goalposts, players or all at once. Each configuration brings with it different search patterns but does not
inhibit other parts of the robot (like vision) from detecting additional field features.
