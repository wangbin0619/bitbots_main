Robotics Competition Checklist
==============================

When Powered Off
----------------
* Check cables for insulation damage
* Inspect cable ties and cable management
* Check cables are correctly in their crimps
* Inspect connectors and renew hot glue if necessary
* Check 3D printed parts for cracks
* Move motors and check for gear damage or stiffness (e.g. overly long screws in joints)
* Inspect cleats are fully screwed in
* Check screws (including those that are hard to access, like under the springs) and replace any missing ones
* Inspect for head wobbling
* Check camera cables for hard bends
* Check if shoulders are bent
* Inspect NUC power connectors

Before Powering On
------------------
* Ensure arms and legs are in the correct configuration (team markers outside, cables loose not coiled)

After Powering On
-----------------
* Verify ROS control torqueless and check robot model in RViz
* Connect hands to legs while watching the robot mode in RViz
* Check for motor communication issues during startup and afterwards
* Run T-pose script
* Test teleop walking
* Test getting up
* Verify robot-specific walking parameters
* Perform extrinsic calibration
* Check camera images for focus and proper transmission
