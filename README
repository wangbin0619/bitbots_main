README
======

This is the vision package of the Hamburg Bit-Bots.
We use the wolves_image_provider_v4l package as image provider.
Settings considering the vision are set in the visionparams.yaml
(bitbots_vision/config/visionparams.yaml)
You do NOT want to enable Debug on the robot.
The color calibration files are created with the wolves colorpicker and a
rosbag.
The source code of the vision is located in bitbots_vision/scripts.
In bitbots_vision/models the tensorflow classifier models are stored. Due to
their size, these are not part of this repository.
To tweak the camera image, use the settings in the image provider.
