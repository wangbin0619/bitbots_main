Dynamic Stack Decider
=====================

The Dynamic Stack Decider (DSD) is a framework for programming robot behavior. It can very roughly be described as something between a statemachine and a behavior tree.
More information about the general idea and also on how to implement a DSD can be found in the corresponding paper.

Besides the package for a DSD there is another package for DSD visualization in rqt. It can be startet as any normal plugin and is very self explanatory.
