Dynamic Stack Decider
=====================

The Dynamic Stack Decider (DSD) is a framework for programming robot behavior. It can very roughly be described as something between a state machine and a behavior tree.
More information about the general idea and also on how to implement a DSD can be found in the corresponding paper.

Besides the package for the DSD implementation there is another package for DSD visualization in rqt. It can be started as any normal plugin and is very self explanatory.
